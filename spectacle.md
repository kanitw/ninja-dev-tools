# Spectacle

**TODO** What is this for.


## Rebinding Shortkeys

Some of spectacles's default shortkeys collide with a number of shortkeys in other applications.  
Open preferences to rebind shortkeys.  Here are my suggested rebinding:

- **Center** - `ctrl+shift+c`
- **FullScreen** - `ctrl+shift+f`
