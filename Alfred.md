# Alfred 2

## Customizing Features

- **Dictionary** - set "Define a word" to `d`
- **Clipboard** - set Hotkey to `ctrl+cmd+c` to avoid collision with Copy Style in many apps.  
- **Terminal/Shell** - set Application to `iTerm2`

## Workflows

- **Paste as Plain Text** - See [this link](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1321-wheres-plaintext-paste/) to see how you can easily create one.  I use `ctrl+opt+v` as the hotkey for this. 

**TODO**
