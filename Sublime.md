# Sublime Text

Sublime text is my favorite text editor.  It's already awesome but customization makes it extremely powerful. 

## Packages

First, [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) makes installing things extremely easy.  
See installation instruction on [the website](https://packagecontrol.io/) to install it. 

Now you should be all set to install useful packages by hitting `cmd + Shift + P`
and choose `Package Control: Install Package`.

### Theme

[SpaceGray](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/) makes the side bar much nicer than the default theme.
